## ℹ️ About

The main goal of this project is to provide a base template for the generation of a production-ready REST API made with `Node.js`, `Express` and `Typescript`. The idea is to avoid having to configure all the tools involved in a project every time it is started and thus be able to focus on the definition and implementation of the business logic.

> 📣 This is an opinionated template. The architecture of the code base and the configuration of the different tools used has been based on best practices and personal preferences.

> This repository is a representation of Clean Architecture practical implementation in Node.JS. We have two videos that is explain the core concept of Clean Architecture and how it solves the problem that we facing in traditional approach while building a backend service.
